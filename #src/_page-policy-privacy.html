			CheMondis uses a communication service provider.
				<br><br>

			data controllers for the processing activities concerning your data. The platform provider in this respect
			primarily determines the purposes and means of the processing activities, which we can influence only to a
			limited extent. To the extent that we can exert influence over or set parameters regarding the processing of
			your data, we will, within our means, take actions to ensure that the platform provider processes your data
			in compliance with applicable data protection regulations.
				<br><br>
			We operate the following social media sites:
				<br><br>
				<span>•</span> LinkedIn:  https://www.linkedin.com/company/STOKEN<br>
				<br>
			The data you provide directly on our social media pages e.g. during events or by using the page, such as
			comments, videos, pictures, likes, tweets etc.are published by the social media platform. The processing by
			us is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR which refers to processing which is done in the interest of public
			relations and communication.

			the efficiency and relevance of our web presence. We determine the success of our activities in order to
			continuously improve our (marketing) activities in your interest and to plan new measures.
				<br><br>

			platform provider leaves us room to exert influence over or set parameters regarding the processing of your
			data, we will design our social media pages to be as compliant as possible with applicable data protection
			rules. We therefore do not make use of demographic, interest-based, behavior-based or location-based target
			group classifications for the purposes of advertising, notwithstanding that such services may (by default)
			be provided to us by the social media platform providers.

			to other secure communication channels that guarantee confidentiality. You always have the option to send us
			confidential inquiries to the address given in the imprint.

			independently of whether or not you are logged in or registered on the social media platform. Unfortunately,
			we cannot influence or restrict the web tracking methods of the social media platform.

			things, your habits, personal relationships and preferences. We have no influence on the processing of your

<h3>
			g). Use of Cookies</h3>
			On our website, we use cookies which are necessary in order for the site to function. Cookies are small text
			files that can be placed on your computer or mobile device by websites that you visit.
				<br><br>
			A distinction is made between session cookies, which are deleted as soon as you close your browser, and
			permanent cookies, which are stored beyond the individual session. We do not use these necessary cookies for
			analysis, tracking or advertising purposes.
			In some cases, these cookies only contain information on certain settings and cannot be linked to a person.
			They may also be necessary to enable user guidance, security and implementation of the site.
				<br><br>
			The legal basis for using these cookies is § 25 (2) No. 2 TTDSG in conjunction with our legitimate interest
			according to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.
				<br><br>
			You can set your browser to inform you about the placement of cookies. This is in order to make the use of
			cookies transparent for you. You can also delete cookies or prevent the setting of new cookies at any time
			by using the appropriate browser settings. Please note that if you delete certain cookies, our web pages may
			not be displayed correctly, and some functions may no longer be available.

			Analytics creates user profiles based on pseudonyms. For this purpose, permanent cookies are stored on your
			end device and accessed out by us.  In this way we are able to recognize and measure returning visitors.
				<br><br>
			The Google Analytics tool is provided by Google Ireland Limited and Google LLC. (USA) who support us as
			processors according to Art. 28 GDPR. The data processing can therefore also take place outside the EU or
			EEA. With regard to Google LLC (USA), no adequate level of data protection can be assumed due to the
			processing in the USA. There is a risk that authorities may access the data for security and surveillance
			purposes without you being informed or having the right to appeal. 
				<br><br>
			Please take this into account if you decide to give your consent to our use of Google Analytics. 
				<br><br>
			The legal basis for this data processing is your consent if you have given your consent via our consent
			banner, according to § 25 (1) TTDSG (consent for the setting or reading of cookies)in conjunction with. Art.
			6 (1) (a) GDPR (consent for the data processing based on it).

			consent at any time.
				<br><br>
			Please follow this link and make the appropriate settings via our banner.
				<br><br>
				<span>
			Embedded Videos</span>
			On our websites, we embed videos that are not hosted on our servers. In order to ensure that accessing our
			websites containing embedded videos does not automatically lead to the download of third-party content, we
			only show locally hosted preview images of the videos as a first step. As a result, the third-party provider
			does not receive any information.
				<br><br>
			Only after you click on the preview image, is content from the third-party provider downloaded. This
			provides the third party with information that you have accessed our site and with the usage data
			technically required for this purpose. Furthermore, the third party provider is then able to implement
			tracking technologies. We have no influence on the further data processing by the third-party provider. By
			clicking on the preview image, you give us your consent to download content from the third-party provider.
				<br><br>
			The embedding is based on your consent if you have given your consent by clicking on the preview image.
			Please note that the embedding of many videos leads to your data being processed outside the EU or EEA. In
			some countries, there is a risk that authorities may access the data for security and surveillance purposes
			without informing you or allowing you to take legal action. Where we use providers in third countries
			without an adequate level of protection and you give your consent, the transfer to this third country is
			based on Art. 49 (1) (a) GDPR.
				<br><br>
				<span>•</span> Provider: Vimeo<br>
				<span>•</span> Adequate level of data protection: No adequate level of data protection. The data is transmitted on the
			basis of Art. 49 (1) (a) GDPR.<br>
				<span>•</span> Withdrawal of consent: If you click on a preview image, the content of the  third-party provider is
			immediately downloaded. To avoid this downloading on  other sites, please do not click on the preview image.<br><br>
<span>
			Third party tracking technologies e.g. for advertising purposes</span><br>
			We use cross-device tracking technologies to help us show you targeted advertising on other websites based
			on your visit to our websites and to help us determine how effective our advertising efforts have been.
				<br><br>
			The legal basis for this data processing is your consent if you have given your consent via our consent
			banner, according to § 25 (1) TTDSG (consent for the setting or reading of cookies) in conjunction with.
			Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR(consent for the data processing based on it).
				<br><br>
			Your consent is voluntary and can be withdrawn at any time.
				<br><br>
			How does tracking work?
			When you visit our websites, it is possible that the third-party providers listed below may retrieve
			identification characteristics of your browser or terminal device (e.g. a browser fingerprint), evaluate
			your IP address, save or extract identification characteristics on your terminal device (e.g. cookies)or
			gain access to individual tracking pixels.
				<br><br>
			The individual characteristics can be used by these third parties to identify your terminal device on other
			websites. We may commission these third-party providers to show you advertisements based on the pages
			visited on our website.
				<br><br>
			What does cross-device tracking mean?
			If you log on to the third-party provider with your user data, the respective identification characteristics
			of different browsers and end device scan be linked with each other. For example, if the third-party
			provider has created a unique identifier for each laptop, desktop personal computer, smartphone or tablet
			you use, these individual identifiers can be associated with each other as soon as you log in to a
			third-party service using your login credentials. This allows the third party to target our advertising
			campaigns across multiple devices.
				<br><br>
			Which third-party providers do we use in this context?
			The third-party providers with whom we work for advertising purposes are listed below. If the data is
			processed outside the EU or EEA in this context, please note that there is a risk that local authorities may
			access the data for security and monitoring purposes without you being informed or having the right to
			appeal. Where we use providers in third countries without an adequate level of protection and you give your
			consent, the transfer to this third country is based on Art. 49 (1) (a) GDPR.

			theft and unauthorised use, access or modification.

			information to those websites.</p>
