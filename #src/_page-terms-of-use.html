			</h1>
			<p>

				(“E-STOKEN”, and such marketplace the “E-STOKEN Platform”), for theFMCG industry enabling the listing
				and searching of suppliers and products, the comparison of product listings and availabilities as well
				as convenient ordering and order fulfillment. The use of the E-STOKEN platform is subject to these
				General Terms of Use (the “Terms of Use”) and the commercial terms of the applicable subscription for

				Terms”).
			</p>
			<h2>1. ADMISSION AND REGISTRATION</h2>
			<p>
				<span>1.1</span> The E-STOKEN Platform may only be used by professional suppliers and (prospective)
				buyers of FMCG products (collectively “Users” and individually a “User”). Non-professional use for
				private purposes (i.e., private consumers in the sense of applicable law) will not be admitted to the
				use of the E-STOKEN Platform. Each User may use the E-STOKEN Platform at the same time, but strictly
				through different Authorized Representatives as defined in Section 1.6 below, to supply FMCG products
				(in such case the relevant User is referred to as a “Supplier”) or to buy FMCG products (in such case
				the relevant User is referred to as a “Buyer”).
				‍</p>
			<p>
				<span>1.2</span> The following requirements have to be met cumulatively to be eligible for registration
				as a User on the E-STOKEN Platform:
				<br>
			<ul>
				<li>
					• registered company;
				</li>
				<li>
					• valid VAT/GST number.
				</li>
			</ul>
			These requirements are subject to change from time to time, including the introduction of additional
			requirements.
			</p>
			<p>	<span>1.3</span> By completing the registration (either by entering registration data itself or
				confirming registration
				data compiled by E-STOKEN for the User and sent to the User for verification), the User submits an offer
				to
				E-STOKEN to enter into an agreement for the use of the E-STOKEN Platform which is exclusively based on
				these
				Terms of Use; any terms and conditions of the User are rejected and shall not be applicable. E-STOKEN
				may
				accept or reject such offer by the User in its sole discretion.
				‍</p>
			<p>
				<span>1.4</span> Upon registration, E-STOKEN may, but shall not be obliged to, subject the User to the
				following
				verifications and checks which may be carried out via external service providers:
			<ul>
				<li>
					• Verification of tax numbers and addresses;
				</li>
				<li>• blacklist check with a view to requirements under applicable trade legislation regarding economic
					sanctions, money laundering, etc.; and
				</li>
				<li>• credit check.
				</li>
			</ul>
			‍
			These verifications and checks are subject to change from time to time, including the introduction of
			additional checks.
			‍</p>
			<p>
				<span>1.5</span>
			 Notwithstanding Section 1.4, the User represents and warrants and shall be solely responsible that any
			information and data provided or confirmed by it in the course of registration is true, accurate and
			complete. E-STOKEN shall not be obliged to review, verify or correct any such information and data. The User
			shall notify E-STOKEN without undue delay of any changes to such information, in particular changes in the
			circumstances which are relevant pursuant to Section 1.1 for admission to the use of the E-STOKEN Platform.
			‍</p>
			<p>
				<span>1.6</span>

			 In the course of registration, each User shall designate one or more individuals who are in an
			employment relationship with the User as being authorized to access and use the E-STOKEN Platform on behalf
			of such User (“Authorized Representatives”) by specifying the e-mail addresses of such individuals within
			the User’s organization. Each Authorized Representative shall only have one account and upon registration
			shall be designated as acting on behalf of the User either (i) in the role as Supplier, (ii) in the role as
			Buyer. Any references in these Terms of Use to a Supplier or Buyer using the E-STOKEN Platform, including
			the entering into any business transactions, shall mean the respective User for which they are acting. In
			addition, Authorized Representatives may be designated to act in the role as administrator of the User to
			administer the account related to the User and to register and unregister either Buyers or Suppliers (but
			not both) of such User in accordance with these Terms of Use (“Administrator”). An Administrator may not at
			the same time be designated or act as Buyer or Supplier.
				<br>
				<br>
			Authorized Representatives who already registered in the role as Supplier must not attempt to register,
			directly or indirectly, in the role as Buyer and vice versa. E-STOKEN reserves the right, but shall not be
			obliged, to verify the identity of Authorized Users with a view to such separation. The User shall be solely
			responsible for ensuring such separation by implementing and strictly maintaining the structural safeguards
			as set forth in Section 8.2(g). Authorized Representative and Administrator accounts are not transferable.
			‍</p>
			<p>
				<span>1.7</span>

			 The E-STOKEN Platform is provided subject to the current state of technology. Availability is subject to
			interruptions due to maintenance, improvements or security measures, and to unscheduled downtime due to
			technical problems, external interference with E-STOKEN’ systems and disruption of Internet connectivity.
			E-STOKEN will reasonably consider the Users’ business interests when scheduling maintenance. E-STOKEN
			reserves the right to limit or suspend access to the E-STOKEN Platform in its sole discretion and with
			reasonable consideration of the Users’ business interests if it considers this necessary with a view to
			maintaining the security, integrity, availability or performance of the E-STOKEN Platform; Section 8.6 shall
			remain unaffected. E-STOKEN may change the appearance and functionality of the E-STOKEN Platform from time
			to time without materially impairing the functionality offered to the User.</p>
			<h2>2. PRODUCT REGULATORY COMPLIANCE</h2>
			<p><span>2.1</span>
			 Suppliers must comply with applicable regulations on the commercial sale of products
			‍</p>
			<p><span>2.2</span>
			 Suppliers are required to provide the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) on the Product Detail Page according to
			Section 3.2 on the E-STOKEN Platform. Technical Data Sheets can be provided optionally.
			‍</p>
			<p><span>
				2.3
			</span>

			 Irrespective of the foregoing, E-STOKEN is not responsible for ensuring and does not guarantee that the
			products comply with any regulatory requirements and have all required regulatory registrations. This shall
			remain the respective Supplier’s sole responsibility.</p>
			<h2>
				3. PRODUCT LISTING AND PRODUCT DETAIL PAGE
			</h2>
			<p>
				<span>3.1</span>

			 Product listings, catalogue information and general information about E-STOKEN are publicly accessible
			on the internet through the E-STOKEN website. Information on list prices and product availability as well as
			quote requests are only available to registered and validated Buyers. The range of products which are
			visible on the E-STOKEN Platform may depend on the type of subscription for the use of the E-STOKEN Platform
			purchased by a Supplier and/or a Buyer. Supplier may choose to make products registered on the E-STOKEN
			Platform visible only to selected Buyers.
			‍</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					3.2
				</span> Every product listed on the E-STOKEN Platform requires a product detail page (“Product Detail Page”) to
				provide all relevant information needed by Buyers to take the purchase decision. The information to be
				provided by the Supplier on the Product Detail Page includes but is not limited to:
				‍
				<ul>
			<li>• safety data sheets/hygienic certification;</li>
			<li>• technical data sheets (optional);</li>
			<li>• product description text;</li>
			<li>• catalogue information (e.g., product category, application and relevant industries);</li>
			<li>• available packages incl. prices and availability.</li>
		</ul>
			‍</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					3.3
				</span>

			 E-STOKEN reserves the right, but shall not be obliged, to revise, modify, supplement, remove or correct
			information and data provided by Suppliers for inclusion in the Product Detail Page with a view to achieving
			a consistent user experience for Buyers and to improve information quality. In such case, E-STOKEN will
			propose such changes to the Supplier and the Supplier shall be responsible for reviewing and implementing
			such changes in the Product Detail Page. In any case, the Supplier remains fully and solely responsible for
			the accuracy, content and legality of the information provided on the Product Detail Page; Section 2.3 shall
			apply accordingly.
			‍</p>
			<p>
				<span>3.4</span>

			 Any product listing on the E-STOKEN Platform has to fit into at least one product category, application
			or industry according to the E-STOKEN product catalogue as applicable from time to time. Listing a product
			that does not fit into any existing product category requires approval by E-STOKEN, and E-STOKEN may choose
			in its sole discretion to create a new product category.
			‍</p>
			<p>
				<span>3.5</span>

			 The Supplier acknowledges and agrees that due to technical reasons a new product listing (i) may not be
			searchable by keyword or category for up to 2 hours during normal operation and (ii) may still be accessible
			and searchable on the E-STOKEN Platform for some time after delisting. E-STOKEN does not guarantee exact
			listing durations.
			‍</p>
			<p>
				<span>3.6</span>

			 Any information displayed or otherwise made available through the E-STOKEN Platform is in English. Any
			translation of such information (including the translation service pursuant to Section 5.2) shall be
			provided for convenience only. Solely the English language version of any information provided on the
			E-STOKEN Platform shall be binding.</p>
			<h2>
				4. SALE AND PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS
			</h2>
			<p>
				<span>4.1</span>
			 E-STOKEN acts as an intermediary only and does not itself list, offer or sell any products on the
			E-STOKEN Platform, nor does it have possession of any such products or verify their quality. Any agreements
			for the purchase of products are entered into solely and directly between the respective Supplier and Buyer.
			E-STOKEN is not party to and has no responsibility or liability under any of these agreements or in relation
			to any of the products.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>4.2</span>

			 A purchase confirmed between a Supplier and a Buyer on the E-STOKEN Platform in accordance with the
			following provisions constitutes a legally binding purchase contract between the involved Users for which
			they are acting based on the terms and conditions agreed by these parties, including any terms and
			conditions posted by a Supplier or, subject to Section 4.3(a)(vii) below, a Buyer.
			‍</p>
			<p>
				<span>4.3</span>

			 E-STOKEN offers the following modes of purchase for the use of the E-STOKEN Platform purchased by a
			Supplier and/or a Buyer, which operate according to the following procedures and requirements.
				<br><br>
			(i) Suppliers may offer products by way of an Deal on their listings to indicate that a certain number of
			packages of a product is available for purchase and shipping with a fixed price and guaranteed availability.
			Offering products by way of an Deal shall not constitute a binding purchase offer by the Supplier but only a
			request to the Buyer to make an offer (invitatio ad offerendum).
				<br><br>
			(ii) Activation of a product listing for Deals requires that relevant package information, prices and
			availability of the respective products are provided by the Supplier.
				<br><br>
			(iii) The Supplier shall ensure its ability to provide the available quantity on packaging level as
			indicated in the product listing. The number of available packages of a certain product is automatically
			reduced by the E-STOKEN Platform upon conclusion of each Deal involving such product. The Supplier shall be
			solely responsible for monitoring product availability, for replenishing its stock of products and for
			updating the availability of packages accordingly in the product listing to ensure that the indicated
			quantity is always actually available.
				<br><br>
			(iv) All quantities available by way of an Deal option have to be ready for immediate dispatch by the
			Supplier. EXW (Incoterms® 2020) applies to any such shipment.
				<br><br>
			(v) All product prices displayed on the Product Detail Page are exclusive of VAT and based on EXW
			(Incoterms® 2020), i.e., excluding shipping costs, customs duties (if any) and any other taxes.  
				<br><br>
			(vi) The Buyer selects the number of packages to buy, moves them to the cart and proceeds to the checkout.
				<br><br>
			(vii) Any purchase of products by way of an Deal is solely based on the Supplier’s terms and conditions. The
			Buyer’s terms and conditions do not apply.
				<br><br>
			(viii) If the Buyer selects the Supplier’s Deal, the transaction proceeds with the checkout. Indication by
			the Buyer of the definitive decision to purchase products based on the Deal by clicking the “Buy” button (or
			triggering any other similar mechanism as may be implemented in the checkout process at the relevant time)
			constitutes a binding offer by the Buyer to the Supplier to purchase the products selected by the Buyer
			based on the Supplier’s Deal. After checkout, the purchase by way of an Instant Deal is either confirmed and
			the Buyer’s offer is accepted by the Supplier via an e-mail confirmation sent by E-STOKEN to both the Buyer
			and the Supplier, or it is rejected by the Supplier, in which case the Buyer is notified by e-mail of such
			rejection.
			‍
			</p>
			<h2>
				5. ADDITIONAL SERVICES, MODIFICATIONS
			</h2>
		<p>
			<span>5.1</span>

			 Suppliers may implement electronic data interchange (EDI) connectivity to the E-STOKEN Platform which
			automates the receipt by Suppliers of purchase orders or product releases from the E-STOKEN Platform to
			trigger the delivery of products by Supplier to the respective Buyers to fulfill purchase transactions
			concluded via the E-STOKEN Platform. Such connectivity is based on infrastructure and services provided to
			E-STOKEN by an external service provider. Section 7.3 shall apply accordingly.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>5.2</span>

			 Suppliers on the E-STOKEN Platform may (i) initiate a credit check in relation to Buyers from whom a
			request in the Instant Deal, Request Offer or Request Agreement modes was received, and/or (ii) following a
			purchase of products by a Buyer, initiate a debt collection request in relation to the relevant Buyer. Such
			request will be processed by E-STOKEN and forwarded to an external service provider as indicated to the
			Supplier when submitting such request. E-STOKEN commissions such external service provider solely in the
			name and on behalf of the Supplier, thus forming an agreement directly between the Supplier and the external
			service provider. By submitting the credit check request, the Supplier authorizes E-STOKEN accordingly.
			E-STOKEN shall not be party to the agreement between the Supplier and the external service provider and not
			incur any obligations vis-à-vis the Supplier in relation to such agreement, and the Supplier shall be solely
			liable for payment of the fees of the external service provider as indicated during the credit check request
			process.
			‍</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					5.3

			 The User may choose to have information displayed or otherwise made available on the E-STOKEN Platform
			translated into certain offered languages other than the standard language English. This feature may not be
			available for all types of information and communication on the E-STOKEN Platform. Such translation is
			generated automatically by means of artificial intelligence. The User acknowledges and agrees that (i) such
			translation is provided for convenience only, (ii) it may be inaccurate or incomplete, (iii) that the User
			and its Authorized Representatives should not rely on such translation under any circumstances, in
			particular when entering into legally binding agreements on the E-STOKEN Platform, and (iv) that it is used
			by the User at its own risk. E-STOKEN shall not be responsible for any damage caused by any inaccuracy,
			incompleteness or other errors or faults in any such translation, including any transactions which are
			affected by any miscommunication resulting from the use of such translation.

			business reasons. E-STOKEN will reasonably consider the User’s legitimate interests when making such
